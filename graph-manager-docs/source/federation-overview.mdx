## What you'll learn

Based on our experience helping companies scale GraphQL across their organizations, there are several steps teams need to take to successfully run a federated graph in production. We recommend running through these steps after you've already [implemented a federated graph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/implementing/):

1. [Register all implementing services](./federation/#1-register-your-implementing-services) with Apollo Graph Manager.
2. [Configure continuous delivery](./federation/#2-configure-continuous-delivery) for schema registration.
3. [Modify your gateway](./federation/#3-modify-the-gateway) to connect it to Graph Manager.
4. [Turn on metrics](./federation-advanced/#metrics-and-observability) for your federated graph.
5. [Validate changes](./federation-advanced/#validating-changes-to-the-graph) to the graph against production traffic.

## Managed configuration

With **managed configuration**, your GraphQL gateway updates dynamically in response to schema changes in your implementing services. You make these service changes with the `apollo service:push` CLI command, which pushes your service configuration files to Graph Manager and stores them securely (as shown in [Register your implementing services](./federation#1-register-your-implementing-services)).

These configuration files define:

* Which implementing services are part of your federated graph
* The partial schema defined by each implementing service
* Metadata about each implementing service, including the `serviceURL` specified in the CLI command

When you initialize your Apollo gateway with a Graph Manager `apiKey` instead of a `serviceList`, the gateway polls Graph Manager regularly to detect and incorporate any changes to your managed configuration. When it detects a change, it continues resolving incoming requests with its existing configuration while it begins to generate query plans for the new configuration. When this process completes, the gateway begins executing new incoming requests against the new configuration.
